=head1 NAME

Type::Tiny::Manual - an overview of Type::Tiny

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Type::Tiny is a small framework for writing type constraints and organizing
them into type libraries. Although inspired by Moose's type constraint API,
it has no non-core dependencies, and can be used with L<Moose>, L<Mouse> and
L<Moo>.

It provides a small Moose-inspired library of built-in type constraints.

Type::Tiny and friends don't need to be used within an OO framework. See L<FreeMind::Node> for an example that does not.

=head1 TYPE::TINY VERSUS X

=head2 Specio 

Type::Tiny is similar in aim to L<Specio>. The major differences are that
Type::Tiny is "tiny"; and Type::Tiny dispenses with the idea of a type
registry and stringy access to type constraints.

=head2 MooseX::Types

Type::Tiny libraries expose a similar interface to L<MooseX::Types> libraries.
In most cases you should be able to rewrite a L<MooseX::Types> library to
use Type::Tiny pretty easily.

=head2 MooX::Types::MooseLike

Type::Tiny is faster and supports coercions.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs to
L<http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=Type-Tiny>.

=head1 SUPPORT

B<< IRC: >> support is available through in the I<< #moose >> channel
on L<irc.perl.org|http://www.irc.perl.org/channels.html>. If Type::Tiny
discussion there becomes overwhelming (unlikely) then I'll move it
to a separate channel.
