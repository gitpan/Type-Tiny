=head1 NAME

Type::Tiny::Manual - an overview of Type::Tiny

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Type::Tiny is a small framework for writing type constraints and organising
them into type libraries. Although inspired by Moose's type constraint API,
it has no non-core dependencies, and can be used with L<Moose>, L<Mouse> and
L<Moo>.

It provides a small Moose-inspired library of built-in type constraints.

Type::Tiny is similar in aim to L<Specio>. The major differences are that
Type::Tiny is "tiny"; and Type::Tiny dispenses with the idea of a type
registry and stringy access to type constraints.
