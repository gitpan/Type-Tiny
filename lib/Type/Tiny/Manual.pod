=head1 NAME

Type::Tiny::Manual - an overview of Type::Tiny

=head1 SYNOPSIS

L<Type::Tiny> is a small class for writing type constraints, inspired by
L<Moose>'s type constraint API. It has no non-core dependencies, and can be
used with L<Moose>, L<Mouse> and L<Moo> (or none of the above).

Type::Tiny is bundled with L<Type::Library> a framework for organizing type
constraints into collections.

Also bundled is L<Types::Standard>, a Moose-inspired library of useful type
constraints.

L<Type::Params> is also provided, to allow very fast checking and coercion
of function and method parameters.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Type::Tiny requires at least Perl 5.6.1, though certain Unicode-related
features (e.g. non-ASCII type constraint names) may work better in newer
versions of Perl.

At run-time, Type::Tiny requires the following modules: L<B>,
L<B::Deparse>, L<Data::Dumper>, L<Scalar::Util>, L<Text::Balanced>,
L<base>, L<overload>, L<strict> and L<warnings>. All of these come
bundled with Perl itself. (Prior to Perl 5.8, L<Scalar::Util> and
L<Text::Balanced> do not come bundled with Perl and will need installing
separately from the CPAN.)

Certain features require additional modules. Tying a variable to a
type constraint (e.g. C<< tie my $count, Int >>) requires L<Type::Tie>;
stack traces on exceptions require L<Devel::StackTrace>. The
L<Reply::Plugin::TypeTiny> plugin for L<Reply> requires L<Reply>
(obviously).

The test suite additionally requires L<Test::More>, L<Test::Fatal>
and L<Test::Requires>. Test::More comes bundled with Perl, but if
you are using a version of Perl older than 5.14, you will need to
upgrade to at least Test::More version 0.96. Test::Requires and
Test::Fatal (plus Try::Tiny which Test::Fatal depends on) are bundled
with Type::Tiny in the C<inc> directory, so you do not need to
install them separately.

Perl 5.6.x support is not well tested; if it proves too burdensome
to maintain, it may be dropped in a future release. 

=head1 TYPE::TINY VERSUS X

=head2 Specio 

Type::Tiny is similar in aim to L<Specio>. The major differences are

=over

=item *

Type::Tiny is "tiny" (Specio will eventually have fewer dependencies
than it currently does, but is unlikely to ever have zero);

=item *

Specio has a somewhat nicer API (better method names; less duplication),
and its API is likely to improve further. Type::Tiny's aims at complete
compatibility with current versions of Moose and Mouse, so there is a
limit to how much I can deviate from the existing APIs of
(Moose|Mouse)::Meta::TypeConstraint.

=back

=head2 MooseX::Types

Type::Tiny libraries expose a similar interface to L<MooseX::Types> libraries.
In most cases you should be able to rewrite a L<MooseX::Types> library to
use Type::Tiny pretty easily.

=head2 MooX::Types::MooseLike

Type::Tiny is faster and supports coercions.

=head2 Scalar::Does

L<Scalar::Does> is somewhat of a precursor to Type::Tiny, but has now been
rewritten to use Type::Tiny internally.

It gives you a C<< does($value, $type) >> function that is roughly equivalent
to C<< $type->check($value) >> except that C<< $type >> may be one of a list
of pre-defined strings (instead of a Type::Tiny type constraint); or may be
a package name in which case it will be assumed to be a role and checked with
C<< $value->DOES($type) >>.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs to
L<http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=Type-Tiny>.

=head1 SUPPORT

B<< IRC: >> support is available through in the I<< #moose >> channel
on L<irc.perl.org|http://www.irc.perl.org/channels.html>. If Type::Tiny
discussion there becomes overwhelming (unlikely) then I'll move it
to a separate channel.
