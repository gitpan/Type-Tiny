=head1 NAME

Exporter::TypeTiny - a small exporter used internally by Type::Library and friends

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<< Y O Y O Y O Y O Y ??? >>

B<< Why >> bundle an exporter with Type-Tiny?

Well, it wasn't always that way. L<Type::Library> had a bunch of custom
exporting code which poked coderefs into its caller's stash. It needed this
so that it could switch between exporting Moose, Mouse and Moo-compatible
objects on request.

Meanwhile L<Type::Utils>, L<Types::TypeTiny> and L<Test::TypeTiny> each
used the venerable L<Exporter.pm|Exporter>. However, this meant they were
unable to use the features like L<Sub::Exporter>-style function renaming
which I'd built into Type::Library:

   ## import "Str" but rename it to "String".
   use Types::Standard "Str" => { -as => "String" };

And so I decided to factor out code that could be shared by all Type-Tiny's
exporters into a single place.

Exporter::TypeTiny supports many of Sub::Exporter's external-facing features
including renaming imported functions with the C<< -as >>, C<< -prefix >> and
C<< -suffix >> options; explicit destinations with the C<< into >> option;
and alternative installers with the C<< installler >> option. But it's written
in only about 40% as many lines of code and has with zero non-core dependencies.

Its internal-facing interface is closer to Exporter.pm, with configuration
done through the C<< @EXPORT >>, C<< @EXPORT_OK >> and C<< %EXPORT_TAGS >>
package variables.

Although builders are not an explicit part of the interface,
Exporter::TypeTiny performs most of its internal duties (including resolution
of tag names to function names, resolution of function names to coderefs, and
installation of coderefs into the target package) as method calls, which
means they can be overridden to provide interesting behaviour. These are not
currently documented, and are still subject to change.

=head2 Functions

These are really for internal use, but can be exported if you need them.

=over

=item C<< mkopt(\@array) >>

Similar to C<mkopt> from L<Data::OptList>. It doesn't support all the
fancy options that Data::OptList does (C<moniker>, C<require_unique>,
C<must_be> and C<name_test>) but runs about 50% faster.

=item C<< mkopt_hash(\@array) >>

Similar to C<mkopt_hash> from L<Data::OptList>. See also C<mkopt>.
