=head1 NAME

Exporter::TypeTiny - a small exporter used internally by Type::Library and friends

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   package MyUtils;
   use base "Exporter::TypeTiny";
   our @EXPORT = qw(frobnicate);
   sub frobnicate { my $n = shift; ... }
   1;

   package MyScript;
   use MyUtils "frobnicate" => { -as => "frob" };
   print frob(42);
   exit;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Exporter::TypeTiny supports many of Sub::Exporter's external-facing features
including renaming imported functions with the C<< -as >>, C<< -prefix >> and
C<< -suffix >> options; explicit destinations with the C<< into >> option;
and alternative installers with the C<< installler >> option. But it's written
in only about 40% as many lines of code and with zero non-core dependencies.

Its internal-facing interface is closer to Exporter.pm, with configuration
done through the C<< @EXPORT >>, C<< @EXPORT_OK >> and C<< %EXPORT_TAGS >>
package variables.

Exporter::TypeTiny performs most of its internal duties (including resolution
of tag names to sub names, resolution of sub names to coderefs, and
installation of coderefs into the target package) as method calls, which
means they can be overridden to provide interesting behaviour.

=head2 Utility Functions

These are really for internal use, but can be exported if you need them.

=over

=item C<< mkopt(\@array) >>

Similar to C<mkopt> from L<Data::OptList>. It doesn't support all the
fancy options that Data::OptList does (C<moniker>, C<require_unique>,
C<must_be> and C<name_test>) but runs about 50% faster.

=item C<< mkopt_hash(\@array) >>

Similar to C<mkopt_hash> from L<Data::OptList>. See also C<mkopt>.

=head1 TIPS AND TRICKS IMPORTING FROM EXPORTER::TYPETINY

For the purposes of this discussion we'll assume we have a module called
C<< MyUtils >> which exports one function, C<< frobnicate >>. C<< MyUtils >>
inherits from Exporter::TypeTiny.

Many of these tricks may seem familiar from L<Sub::Exporter>. That is
intentional. Exporter::TypeTiny doesn't attempt to provide every feature of
Sub::Exporter, but where it does it usually uses a fairly similar API.

=head2 Basic importing

   # import "frobnicate" function
   use MyUtils "frobnicate";

   # import all functions that MyUtils offers
   use MyUtils -all;

=head2 Renaming imported functions

   # call it "frob"
   use MyUtils "frobnicate" => { -as => "frob" };

   # call it "my_frobnicate"
   use MyUtils "frobnicate" => { -prefix => "my_" };

   # call it "frobnicate_util"
   use MyUtils "frobnicate" => { -suffix => "_util" };

   # import it twice with two different names
   use MyUtils
      "frobnicate" => { -as => "frob" },
      "frobnicate" => { -as => "frbnct" };

=head2 Lexical subs

   {
      use Sub::Exporter::Lexical lexical_installer => { -as => "lex" };
      use MyUtils { installer => lex }, "frobnicate";
      
      frobnicate(...);  # ok
   }
   
   frobnicate(...);  # not ok

=head2 Import functions into another package

   use MyUtils { into => "OtherPkg" }, "frobnicate";
   
   OtherPkg::frobincate(...);

=head2 Import functions into a scalar

   my $func;
   use MyUtils "frobnicate" => { -as => \$func };
   
   $func->(...);

=head2 Import functions into a hash

OK, Sub::Exporter doesn't do this...

   my %funcs;
   use MyUtils { into => \%funcs }, "frobnicate";
   
   $funcs{frobnicate}->(...);

=head1 TIPS AND TRICKS EXPORTING USING EXPORTER::TYPETINY

Simple configuration works the same as L<Exporter>; inherit from this module,
and use the C<< @EXPORT >>, C<< @EXPORT_OK >> and C<< %EXPORT_TAGS >>
package variables to list subs to export.

=head2 Generators

Exporter::TypeTiny has always allowed exported subs to be generated (like
L<Sub::Exporter>), but until version 0.025 did not have an especially nice
API for it.

Now, it's easy. If you want to generate a sub C<foo> to export, list it in
C<< @EXPORT >> or C<< @EXPORT_OK >> as usual, and then simply give your
exporter module a class method called C<< _generate_foo >>.

   push @EXPORT_OK, 'foo';
   
   sub _generate_foo {
      my $class = shift;
      my ($name, $args, $globals) = @_;
      
      return sub {
         ...;
      }
   }

You can also generate tags:

   my %constants = (FOO => 1, BAR => 2);
   use constant \%constants;
   
   $EXPORT_TAGS{constants} = sub {
      my $class = shift;
      my ($name, $args, $globals) = @_;
      
      return keys(%constants);
   };

=head2 Overriding Internals

An important difference between L<Exporter> and Exporter::TypeTiny is that
the latter calls all its internal functions as I<< class methods >>. This
means that you subclass can I<< override them >> to alter their behaviour.

The following methods are available to be overridden. Despite being named
with a leading underscore, they are considered public methods. (The underscore
is there to avoid accidentally colliding with any of your own function names.)

=over

=item C<< _exporter_validate_opts($globals) >>

This method is called once each time C<import> is called. It is passed a
reference to the global options hash. (That is, the optional leading hashref
in the C<use> statement, where the C<into> and C<installer> options can be
provided.)

You may use this method to munge the global options, or validate them,
throwing an exception or printing a warning.

The default implementation does nothing interesting.

=item C<< _exporter_expand_tag($name, $args, $globals) >>

This method is called to expand an import tag (e.g. C<< ":constants" >>).
It is passed the tag name (minus the leading ":"), an optional hashref
of options (like C<< { -prefix => "foo_" } >>), and the global options
hashref.

It is expected to return a list of ($name, $args) arrayref pairs. These
names can be sub names to export, or further tag names (which must have
their ":"). If returning tag names, be careful to avoid creating a tag
expansion loop!

The default implementation uses C<< %EXPORT_TAGS >> to expand tags, and
provides fallbacks for the C<< :default >> and C<< :all >> tags.

=item C<< _exporter_expand_sub($name, $args, $globals) >>

This method is called to translate a sub name to a hash of name => coderef
pairs for exporting to the caller. In general, this would just be a hash with
one key and one value, but, for example, Type::Library overrides this method
so that C<< "+Foo" >> gets expanded to:

   (
      Foo         => sub { $type },
      is_Foo      => sub { $type->check(@_) },
      to_Foo      => sub { $type->assert_coerce(@_) },
      assert_Foo  => sub { $type->assert_return(@_) },
   )

The default implementation checks that the name is allowed to be exported
(using the C<_exporter_permitted_regexp> method), gets the coderef using
the generator if there is one (or by calling C<< can >> on your exporter
otherwise) and calls C<_exporter_fail> if it's unable to generate or
retrieve a coderef.

=item C<< _exporter_permitted_regexp($globals) >>

This method is called to retrieve a regexp for validating the names of
exportable subs. If a sub doesn't match the regexp, then the default
implementation of C<_exporter_expand_sub> will refuse to export it. (Of
course, you may override the default C<_exporter_expand_sub>.)

The default implementation of this method assembles the regexp from
C<< @EXPORT >> and C<< @EXPORT_OK >>.

=item C<< _exporter_fail($name, $args, $globals) >>

Called by C<_exporter_expand_sub> if it can't find a coderef to export.

The default implementation just throws an exception. But you could emit
a warning instead, or just ignore the failed export.

If you don't throw an exception then you should be aware that this
method is called in list context, and any list it returns will be treated
as an C<_exporter_expand_sub>-style hash of names and coderefs for
export.

=item C<< _exporter_install_sub($name, $args, $globals, $coderef) >>

This method actually installs the exported sub into its new destination.
Its return value is ignored.

The default implementation handles sub renaming (i.e. the C<< -as >>,
C<< -prefix >> and C<< -suffix >> functions. This method does a lot of
stuff; if you need to override it, it's probably a good idea to just
pre-process the arguments and then call the super method rather than
trying to handle all of it yourself.

=head1 HISTORY

B<< Why >> bundle an exporter with Type-Tiny?

Well, it wasn't always that way. L<Type::Library> had a bunch of custom
exporting code which poked coderefs into its caller's stash. It needed this
so that it could switch between exporting Moose, Mouse and Moo-compatible
objects on request.

Meanwhile L<Type::Utils>, L<Types::TypeTiny> and L<Test::TypeTiny> each
used the venerable L<Exporter.pm|Exporter>. However, this meant they were
unable to use the features like L<Sub::Exporter>-style function renaming
which I'd built into Type::Library:

   ## import "Str" but rename it to "String".
   use Types::Standard "Str" => { -as => "String" };

And so I decided to factor out code that could be shared by all Type-Tiny's
exporters into a single place.

As of version 0.026, this module is also available as L<Exporter::Tiny>,
distributed independently on CPAN.

=head1 OBLIGATORY EXPORTER COMPARISON

Exporting is unlikely to be your application's performance bottleneck, but
nonetheless here are some comparisons.

B<< Comparative sizes according to L<Devel::SizeMe>: >>

   Sub::Exporter::Progressive   263.2Kb
   Exporter::TypeTiny           267.7Kb
   Exporter + Exporter::Heavy   281.5Kb
   Exporter::Renaming           406.2Kb
   Sub::Exporter                701.0Kb

B<< Performance exporting a single sub: >>
