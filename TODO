  * Type-Tiny
      * improve speed for non-inlineable type constraints and coercions
          * maybe use eval context idea from Type::Check
      * Type-Tiny could be used as a backend for Scalar::Does?
          * if not, certainly a SEE ALSO
      * improved error messages
          * an ArrayRef[Int] should be able to tell you what elements
            are not Ints
          * if something is not a number, then the Int error message
            should report that; not just report that it's not an Int
