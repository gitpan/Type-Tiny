      * documentation
          * usage with Mouse
              * using type constraints from libraries
              * creating type constraints using Type::Utils
              * coercions
      * integration with MooX-late
      * new type constraints for Types::Standard
          * Chars - i.e. strings where the UTF-8 bit is on
          * Bytes - i.e. strings where the UTF-8 bit is off
          * Tied - i.e. references to tied variables. Parameterized:
            Tied["Some::Package"]
          * Varchar[length]
          * steal from MooseX-Types-Common?
          * steal from MooseX-Types-Ro?
      * coercion
          * Auto-coercion
              * could do with better tests
              * needs documenting
              * needs merge with tip
              * need a way of switching this feature on/off?
              * generated coercion functions could maybe be returned as
                thunks?
          * investigate to what extent child types should inherit
            coercions
