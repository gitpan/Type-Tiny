Running the test suite
======================

In the main directory for the distribution (i.e. the directory containing
dist.ini), run the following command:

	prove -lr "t"



Test suite structure
====================

Each test should contain its own documentation in pod format.

t/20-unit/
	- unit tests for each module in the distribution

t/30-integration/
	- integration tests for using Type-Tiny with other software
	- these should be skipped if the other software is not available

t/40-regression/
	- tests related to specific bug reports

t/lib/
	- support files for test cases.

t/*.t
	- miscellaneous other tests

t/*.pl
	- support files for managing test cases
