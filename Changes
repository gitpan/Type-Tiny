   internals-hacking.
 - (Documentation) Document the internals of Exporter::TypeTiny.
 - (Packaging) Take advantage of dynamic_config to ask automated testers to

   BBYRD++
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=88064>
 - (Bugfix) Stop considering the empty string to be a valid package name.
 - (Change) Implementation of RegexpRef in Types::Standard is now closer to
   Moose's implementation (accepts blessed Regexps).
 - (Packaging) Include additional test cases stolen from Moose.

0.023_02	2013-08-23

 - (Addition) Type::Registry now has an `add_type` method, for adding a
   single type constraint to a registry.
 - (Bugfix) Fix quoting in error messages which caused Type::Params to be
   unable to compile some coderefs.
   Fixes #87846.
   Tim Bunce++
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=87846>

   structures of nested references.
   Fixes #87999.
   Tim Bunce++

 - (Change) Type::Registry's `add_types` method now supports importing
   MooseX::Types and MouseX::Types libraries.
 - (Change) Type::Utils' `extend` function now supports extending
   MooseX::Types and MouseX::Types libraries.

0.023_01	2013-08-16

 - (Bugfix) Fix Moo -> Moose type inflation issue.
   Matt Phillips++

0.022	2013-08-06

 - (Change) Improved implementations of
   is_subtype_of/is_strictly_subtype_of; better for subclassing.
 - (Change) In Devel::TypeTiny::Perl56Compat, `use strict` and `use
   warnings`.
 - (Documentation) Updated NEWS file.

0.021_04	2013-07-30

 - (Bugfix) Fix Type::Parser's handling of numeric parameters; they
   shouldn't need quoting.
 - (Bugfix) Fix Types::Standard::Dict differentiating between undef and not
   exists.
   Fixes #87443.
   Tim Bunce++
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=87443>
 - (Packaging) Add dependency on Exporter 5.57 for older versions of Perl.

0.021_03	2013-07-30

 - (Change) Improve compatibility between Type::Tiny and Moose attribute
   native traits.
 - (Change) Restore Eval::TypeTiny's pre-0.019_01 behaviour re closing over
   lexicals, but enable the 0.021_02 behaviour if alias=>1 option is passed
   in.

0.021_02	2013-07-26

 - (Change) Use real lexicals again for Eval::TypeTiny; this requires
   Devel::LexAlias, but there's a fallback to using tied variables.

0.021_01	2013-07-24

 - (Addition) Type::Tiny is_strictly_a_type_of method.
 - (Addition) Type::Tiny is_strictly_subtype_of method.

 - (Bugfix) Work around lack of B::perlstring() function in Perl 5.6.x in
   test suite.

0.018	2013-07-21

 - (Documentation) Updated NEWS file.

0.017_02	2013-07-20

 - (Bugfix) Further changes for Perl 5.6.x support.
 - (Change) Hopefully improved workaround for missing B::perlstring() using
   Data::Dumper instead of quotemeta().
   Peter Rabbitson++

0.017_01	2013-07-19

 - (Bugfix) Work around lack of B::perlstring() function in Perl 5.6.x.
 - (Documentation) Fix typo in Types::Standard 'regular exception' ->
   'regular expression'.
   Mark Stosberg++
   <https://github.com/tobyink/p5-type-tiny/pull/4>

   Tim Bunce++
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=86892>
 - (Update) Eval::TypeTiny now supports lexical subs under Perl 5.18.

0.016	2013-07-16

 - (Documentation) Add some pod links.
 - (Documentation) Updated NEWS file.

0.015_05	2013-07-15

 - (Change) Experimentally drop required version of Perl from 5.8.1 to
   5.6.1. I've not been able to extensively test Type-Tiny on Perl 5.6.x,
   but I believe it should mostly work. (The only feature that seems
   unlikely to work is non-ASCII names for type constraints and coercions.)
 - (Change) Stop monkey-patching Moose::Meta::TypeContraint; it's not
   necessary and has never been documented.

0.015_04	2013-07-13

 - () Allow an inline_as block to return a list of strings (which are
   implictly joined with &&); allow the first item on the list to be undef,
   which is treated as the inlined parent type constraint.
   Fixes #86891.
   Tim Bunce++
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=86891>
 - (Documentation) Clarify when inlining via Sub::Quote may be less
   efficient than hand-written inlining.
   Fixes #86893.
   Tim Bunce++
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=86893>
 - (Documentation) Mention in Type::Tiny::Manual::Libraries that the
   `extends` function is no longer exported by default; update example
   code.
   Fixes #86813.
   Pierre Masci++
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=86813>
   <https://github.com/tobyink/p5-type-tiny/pull/2>

0.015_03	2013-07-08

 - (Addition) Implement TIESCALAR, TIEARRAY and TIEHASH methods for
   Type::Tiny; this improves Type::Tie integration.
 - (Change) Slight speed improvements for `compile_match_on_type`.
 - (Change) The `dwim_type` function now prioritizes lookups within the
   caller class' type registry over Types::Standard's built-in types.

0.015_02	2013-07-06

 - (Change) Better test cases for `dwim_type`.
 - (Change) Improvements to DWIMness of Type::Parser for the benefit of
   `dwim_type`.

0.015_01	2013-07-05

 - (Addition) Type::Utils now provides a `dwim_type` function; this is
   powered by a hidden Type::Registry::DWIM package.
 - (Change) Type::Parser can now pull in types from MooseX::Types libraries
   properly.

0.014	2013-06-28

 - (Documentation) Updated NEWS file.

0.013_01	2013-06-27

 - (Addition) Type::Parser now provides a `extract_type` function which
   parses a type constraint expression from the head of a string and
   returns a Type::Tiny object, plus the tail of the string. (This is
   designed to make it easier to use Type::Parser to parse things like
   function signatures.)
 - (Change) Type::Parser's tokenization is now done on a pull basis,
   allowing one-pass building of the AST.
 - (Removal) Type::Parser functions no longer accept an arrayref of tokens,
   as they expect to pull tokens from a stream as required.
 - (Removal) Type::Parser no longer provides a `tokens` function as it no
   longer pre-emptively tokenizes the whole string it is given.

0.012	2013-06-25

 - (Documentation) Updated NEWS file.

0.011_03	2013-06-25

 - (Bugfix) Type::Tiny now overloads `cmp`. Necessary because Mouse does a
   sort on type constraints in a union, and overload's fallback doesn't
   seem to cover `cmp` on Perl prior to 5.12.

0.011_02	2013-06-25

 - (Bugfix) Types::Standard 0.009_02 stopped including 'library' attribute
   in its types, and thus broke MooX::late. Type::Library modified to make
   'library' attribute more automatic, and less reliant on Type::Utils to
   do the right thing.
   Graham Knop++

0.011_01	2013-06-25

 - (Addition) Types::Standard::to_TypeTiny now accepts any object
   implementing the Type::API::Constraint or
   Type::API::Constraint::Coercion interfaces. As
   Mouse::Meta::TypeConstraint implements this interface, specific support
   for importing Mouse types has been dropped; the generic Type::API import
   'just works' for Mouse types.
 - (Addition) Types::Standard::to_TypeTiny now accepts unblessed coderefs
   and converts them to type constraints. This allows things like `Int &
   sub { $_ < 10 }` to work.
 - (Bugfix) B::SPECIAL-related fix.
   Fixes #86383.
   Peter Flanigan++
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=86383>
 - (Bugfix) Unions of Type::Tiny and Mouse::Meta::TypeConstraints now work
   properly. This makes Type::Tiny and MouseX::Types play nice together
   (much like Type::Tiny already plays nice with MooseX::Types).
 - (Change) Cleanups within Type::Coercion. Necessary because in some
   places the entire type_coercion_map (including conversion coderefs) was
   passed through Types::Standard::to_TypeTiny, when really only the type
   constraints should have been.

0.010	2013-06-24

 - (Documentation) Updated NEWS file.

0.009_07	2013-06-24

 - (Change) If a Type::Tiny object is instantiated with a Sub::Quote quoted
   constraint coderef, and no inlined coderef, then Type::Tiny will use
   Sub::Quote to make an inlined coderef.
 - (Change) Subclasses of Type::Tiny reject 'inlined' coderef, just like
   they already reject 'constraint' coderef.
 - (Change) Type::Params no longer uses Type::Utils.
 - (Change) Types::Standard::to_TypeTiny now sets 'display_name' instead of
   'name' on generated type constraints.
 - (Packaging) Make rt86172.t an 'xt' test case because it's causing random
   CPAN testers failures unrelated to the feature it's supposed to be
   testing.
 - (Packaging) More test cases for interacting with MooseX::Types type
   constraints.

0.009_06	2013-06-23

 - (Bugfix) Careful calling the DOES method (it doesn't exist in Perl 5.8).

0.009_05	2013-06-23

 - (Bugfix) Type::Registry does the AUTOLOAD thing, so ought to provide a
   DESTROY method.

0.009_04	2013-06-23

 - (Bugfix) Type::Tiny::Class shouldn't completely trust @ISA when
   establishing parent class heirarchies.
 - (Change) Constructors for Type::Tiny subclasses no longer accept the
   'constraint' parameter; it doesn't make sense.
 - (Update) Support Type::API interfaces.

0.009_03	2013-06-22

 - (Bugfix) Fix Types::Standard compilation errors under Perl 5.8.x.

0.009_02	2013-06-22

 - (Bugfix) Fix for compiled_checks for type constraints inheriting from
   Type::Tiny::Class, etc.
   Richard Simões++
 - (Change) Types::Standard no longer uses Type::Utils.
 - (Change) Various minor optimizations for Eval::TypeTiny, Type::Tiny,
   etc.
 - (Regression) Types::Standard types no longer have 'library' attribute
   set; this subtly breaks Moo type inflation, and breaks the MooX::late
   test suite which relies on type inflation working correctly.

0.009_01	2013-06-21

 - (Addition) Reply::Plugin::TypeTiny.
 - (Bugfix) Fix error messages from type constraints with null constraint
   coderefs.

0.008	2013-06-21

 - (Documentation) Updated NEWS file.

0.007_10	2013-06-21

 - (Addition) Type::Parser now exports a _std_eval function useful for
   testing.
 - (Addition) Type::Parser now supports parentheses in its DSL.
 - (Bugfix) Fixed many small parsing bugs in Type::Parser.
 - (Bugfix) MooseX::Types objects used in Type::Tiny::Union,
   Type::Tiny::Intersection and parameterized Type::Tiny type constraints
   would break in some circumstances, as Types::TypeTiny::to_TypeTiny was
   failing to convert them to native Type::Tiny type constraints.
   Fixes #86303.
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=86303>
 - (Change) Improved error messages from Type::Parser.
 - (Documentation) Document status of Type::Registry.
 - (Packaging) Better test cases for Type::Registry.

 - (Bugfix) Fix problem with interaction between constraints, coercions,
   and Moose classes that inherit from Moo classes.
   Fixes #86172.
   Peter Flanigan++
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=86172>

0.007_07	2013-06-16

 - (Bugfix) Partly roll back prototype changes. Now we use `;$` for Perl
   since 5.14, but `;@`, for older Perls that don't support `;$` so well.

0.007_06	2013-06-16

 - () Better prototypes (was `;@`, now `;$`) for parameterizable type
   'constants' exported by type libraries.
   Matt S Trout++
 - (Addition) Type::Exception is now capable of supplying stack traces
   (requires Devel::StackTrace).
 - (Change) Exceptions thrown for Moo isa/coerce now indicate which
   attribute was involved.
 - (Change) Type::Utils no longer exports 'extends' by default!!
 - (Documentation) Document the evaluation environment used by

0.007_05	2013-06-12

 - (Addition) Add match_on_type and compile_match_on_type to Type::Utils.
 - (Addition) Test cases for InstanceOf, ConsumerOf, HasMethods and Enum

   Type::Params. (Not documented yet.)
 - (Documentation) Mention Scalar::Does and Type::Tie in manual.
 - (Documentation) Vastly improved documentation for Type::Utils.
 - (Documentation) Vastly improved documentation for Types::Standard.

0.007_04	2013-06-09

   Vyacheslav Matyukhin++
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=85895>
 - (Bugfix) The combination of Dict, Optional and coercions seems to have
   been broken in certain circumstances.
   Fixes #86001.
   Diab Jerius++
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=86001>

0.007_03	2013-06-08

 - (Bugfix) Inlining of certain deep Dict, Tuple and Map coercions was
   broken, but Type::Params attempted to inline them anyway, leading to
   death.
   Fixes #85911.
   Diab Jerius++
   <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=85911>
 - (Documentation) Better document Type::Tiny's 'parents' method which
   differs from the Moose method of the same name.

0.007_02	2013-06-04

 - (Addition) New constraints added to Types::Standard: InstanceOf,
   ConsumerOf, HasMethods and Enum.
   Graham Knop++
 - (Change) Allow constraint_generators (for parameterizable type
   constraints) to return full Type::Tiny objects instead of plain
   coderefs.
 - (Change) Drop use of Carp in Type::Parser.
 - (Change) Type::Tiny::Class types now have an automatically calculated
   parent type constraint based on @ISA.

   type constraint.
 - (Change) Type::Tiny::Role types now have a parent type constraint of
   Types::Standard::Object.

   parent type constraint based on the most specific common parent type
   constraint.
 - (Documentation) Improvements to Type::Tiny::Manual.
 - (Documentation) Improvements to Type::Tiny::Manual::Params, including
   rewritten manual processing section, and processing type constraints in
   function signatures via Function::Parameters/Attribute::Constract.
 - (Packaging) Test cases for usage with Function::Parameters.

0.007_01	2013-06-01	Happy birthday to me...

 - (Packaging) Exporter::TypeTiny::mkopt_hash now works.

0.005_08	2013-05-28

 - (Packaging) Rearrange test cases; add 00-begin.t.
 - (Update) Use JSON::PP instead of JSON in test cases, because JSON::PP is
   a core module since Perl 5.14.

0.005_07	2013-05-28

 - (Addition) Add pure-Perl Mouse to examples/benchmark-constraints.pl.
 - (Bugfix) Assertions using the assert_return pattern were triggering
   FATAL warnings when inlined with Sub::Quote. Inlined assertions are now
   prefixed with 'no warnings "void";'.

0.005_06	2013-05-26

 - (Bugfix) Fix StrMatch to properly support regexps containing slashes.
 - (Change) Fold Types::Standard::DeepCoercion into Types::Standard.

0.005_05	2013-05-24

 - (Addition) Type::Tiny now has an assert_return method, which is used in
   most places in preference to assert_valid.
 - (Change) Fix warnings under Perl 5.18.
 - (Removal) Removed Type::Registry from the release; it will return at a
   later date.
 - (Update) Suggest newer version of Validation::Class.

0.005_04	2013-05-17

 - (Change) No longer need to add '-mouse' when importing types into Mouse
   libraries. (Same change as what we did for Moose in 0.000_11.)
 - (Change) Various minor changes to Exporter::TypeTiny to make it more
   Sub::Exporter compatible.
 - (Documentation) Add lots of stuff to Type::Tiny::Manual::UsingWithMouse.
 - (Documentation) Document deep coercions (feature added in 0.003_01).

0.003_05	2013-04-19

 - (Addition) Allow coercions to accept parameters.
 - (Addition) Chars and Bytes types added to Types::Standard.
 - (Addition) Encode, Decode, Join and Split coercions added to
   Types::Standard.
 - (Addition) Type::Tiny::Class now has a plus_constructors method.
 - (Bugfix) Prevent warnings (about 'my $val' masking a previously declared
   variable) when several Str checks are being inlined in close proximity,
   such as Tuple[Str,Str]
 - (Documentation) Document Exporter::TypeTiny.
 - (Documentation) Type::Tiny::Manual::Coercions.

0.003_04	2013-04-18

 - (Change) Factor out the sub exporting code scattered around (in
   Type::Utils, Types::TypeTiny and Type::Library) into a single module,
   Exporter::TypeTiny.

0.003_03	2013-04-17

 - (Addition) Add OptList data type to Types::Standard, plus MkOpt
   coercion.

 - (Change) Avoid unnecessarily regenerating parameterized type
   constraints.
 - (Documentation) Document how to process sub parameters with Type::Tiny,
   and point people towards Type::Params.

0.003_01	2013-04-16

 - (Addition) Allow subtypes to inherit coercions from their parent type
   constraint. (They do not by default.)
 - (Addition) Build coercions automatically for certain type parameterized
   constraints. Say there's a Num->Int coercion defined; then we should be
   able to coerce ArrayRef[Num]->ArrayRef[Int].
 - (Addition) Overload "+" operator for Type::Coercion and Type::Tiny
   allows coercions to be added to each other, and added to type
   constraints.
 - (Addition) Type::Library packages can now include "standalone"
   Type::Coercion objects, not attached to a type constraint. These can be
   exported on request.
 - (Change) Allow a Type::Tiny object to "freeze" its coercions. This
   prevents a Type::Tiny object from becoming out of sync with its
   equivalent Mouse or Moose constraint objects.
 - (Documentation) Link from Test::TypeTiny to Test::Deep::Type.

   Type::Utils::from()) now also accept Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint
   objects.
