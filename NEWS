2014-01-01 Type-Tiny version 0.038 released!

 - Fix for Type::Tiny on Perl 5.6.x (which has been broken since 0.032
   I think). I'm now testing Perl 5.6.2 on Travis-CI, so hopefully this
   won't happen again.
 - Fix problems with Moo 1.4.x on threaded Perls.

2014-03-17 Type-Tiny version 0.040 released!

 - Deprecated module Exporter::TypeTiny is now gone.
 - Restructure and expand test suite.
 - Coercion bugfixes.
 - Improvements to overloaded operations on parameterized types.
 - Fix problems with threaded Perl 5.18.x.
