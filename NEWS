2013-11-05 Type-Tiny version 0.032 released!

 - Dict[`a] is now allowed to take a slurpy parameter for validating any
   remaining key/value pairs.
 - Maybe[`a] now has a deep coercion.
 - Tuple[] (with empty parameter list) now explicitly tests for an empty
   arrayref. (Ditto Dict[] for an empty hashref.)

2014-01-01 Type-Tiny version 0.038 released!

 - Fix for Type::Tiny on Perl 5.6.x (which has been broken since 0.032
